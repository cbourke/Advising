For all information regarding internships, consult with Bhuvana Gopal <bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu>

## Additional Notes

1. If the company that the student wants to intern with is not listed in the dropdown on the portal website mentioned in the attached pdf, please have the student reach out to (<bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu>) with the company name and full mailing address including zip code, and I will add it to the list. Once I do so they can proceed with the steps outlined in the pdf.

2. Regardless of what the duration of their internship is for the summer, starting Summer of 2024, we only have one 5 week session of CSCE 495 we offer. Students who have internships with varying durations can contact me by email and I can work with them on ensuring that their academic contract is met correctly.

3. Often, students come to me without consulting the academic advisors and figuring out how many credits they need to take CSCE 495 for. So please let them know they need to meet with you first to figure out the number of credits.
If the student wishes to work with a faculty member on research related opportunities and count that as an internship, please have them consult you before they do so, and determine that CSCE 495 is the right venue for them, and not a directed independent study. If you feel that they need it for the internship requirement since they are unable to find an outside internship (i.e, if the academic advisor approves of the students taking CSCE 495 for research), I am happy to let them enroll.

4. If the student requires a CPT form that lists CSCE 495 as the course for the CPT, then they need to fill it out completely, and send it to me as an editable pdf where I will insert my signature and send it back to them.

5. Any forms through the ISSO, that involve immigration, go through the advising staff, not me.
