# Curriculum

## Pass/No Pass Rules

* UNL Rules: https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/pass-no-pass/

  * Max of 24 credit hours, C or better for P

* UNL Procedure: https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/grade-information/#passnopass

* CoE Rules: https://catalog.unl.edu/undergraduate/engineering/

  * Up to 12 hours of ACE 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  * No required engineering/technical elective with P/NP (optional would be okay)

* Prior to the deadline (usually about week 8), students can switch to P/NP
by themselves through the registration system (Scheduler, Current Schedule,
Edit/Drop dropdown).  This is not an operation advisors can do on behalf of
students.


## Focus Areas

* List of Focus Areas and courses: <https://computing.unl.edu/focus-areas/>
* As far as advising is concerned, focus areas are not formally recognized by the
  University and so there is no process to declare a Focus Area and it is
  not tracked in any system.  A student can request a Focus Area with their
  advisor and the School will print/sign a physical certificate but that is
  about it.  Students should be encouraged to include it in their resume/CV
  and talk about it in interviews.

## Changing Majors

SoC Advisors can only change majors of students *to* a computing major

of the School of Computing need to speak to an advisor in the program that
they are changing to.

  * Click 'new academic program change' on the left

    * Degree Dropdown: select appropriate degree program

## Clearing Advising Holds

  * Log in to MyRed

  * Under "ADV. HOLD" there should be a "Yes", click it
  * Multiple holds may appear; select "ADV"
  * Click "Release" and confirm

## Communication With Advisees

  * You can find a list of your advisees in the Salesforce application
    <https://unlincoln.my.salesforce.com/>
  * Personal contact information can be found in Salesforce
  * Bulk communication to all advisees is generally easier through
    MyRed: My Advisees > Filter + Email

## Internships

  * Bhuvana Gopal <bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu> manages all internship credits
    for all majors
  * A PDF document ([CSCE495-enrollmentProcess.pdf](./documents/CSCE495-enrollmentProcess.pdf))
    may be shared with students that outlines the process for registering
    for internships.

## Substitutions

Substitutions can generally be made for any requirement.  Simple examples include:

  * Substituting a UGEP 250 (study abroad through Global Experiences) as an ACE 9
    which requires a reflection paper (https://globalexperiences.unl.edu/academics/ace-9-requirement)

Advisors (faculty and staff) do not have the ability to apply a direct substitution.
Instead, a request must be made to the staff advisor or directly to
Graduation Services at <gradservices.registrar@unl.edu>
