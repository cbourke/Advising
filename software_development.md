# Curriculum

## Substitutions

Substitutions can be provided; specifically:
  * If a student takes two 155* courses; only one will count in general (the other
    will simply be "hours"; count toward GPA)
  * To allow students to count a non-CSCE course toward the minor

Process:
  * The student should contact the SD Faculty Advisor, provide the course
    number, description, syllabus (ideally)
  * SD Faculty Advisor forwards a "substitution" or "waiver" request for
    the course to count toward the minor (*as well as* any other requirements)
    to an SoC advisor who will forward to the registrar
  * General whitelisted courses can be programmed into DARS by making a request
    to Gale Meyer/Katie Kerr
