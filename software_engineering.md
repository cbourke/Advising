# Curriculum

## Course Sequencing & Frequency

  * SOFT 466 (Software Design and Architecture) offered *every other spring* (odd year, spring 2023)
  * SOFT 467 (Testing, Verification and Analysis) offered *every fall*
  * SOFT 468 (Requirements Elicitation, Modeling and Analysis) offered *every other spring* (even year, spring 2024)
  * SOFT 469 (Secure Software Engineering) offered *every fall*
  * Note: 466, 467, 468, 469 are all *required* by the major (order matters)
  * It should be rare, but if an SE major misses one of these required Technical Electives; reasonable substitutions can be made.  Ex:  
    * For SOFT 466, CSCE 455 may be a good choice (Cloud-services architecture
      and cloud-based apps; some aspects of architecture)
    * For SOFT 467, 425 may be good (compiler construction)
    * 468: ANY

## Internship Requirements

  * See [Internships](./internships) 

# Misc

  * SOFT 461 is required until AY 2023. Starting this year (AY 2024), we replaced
    SOFT 461 with SOFT 469.
  * As of 2024-01-28 DARs should have been updated to allow C or better (instead of
    the original C+ or better) for core SE courses (contact: Gail Mayer <gmeyer2@unl.edu>)
