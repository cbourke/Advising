# Internship Requirements for Software Engineering Majors

* All Software Engineering majors are required to have an internship as part of their degree program.
* Once you get an internship, you can enroll in **1 credit hour** of CSCE 495 to fulfill this requirement.
* You can apply this credit to any semester during or after your internship.  We recommend *not* applying it
  to a summer semester (unless you also plan to enroll in other classes) as you will incur full fees.  You
  can apply the credit to the following fall semester if you wish.
* For enrollment instructions, see [CSCE495-enrollmentProcess.pdf](./CSCE495-enrollmentProcess.pdf)
* To get an internship:
  * Make sure to attend all semesterly career fairs, bring your resume and network
  * Be sure to attend any special visits by employers to the department
  * Be sure to follow Bits & Bytes for other opportunities
  * Use UNL's [Handshake](https://unl.joinhandshake.com) website which lists other internship opportunities
* Note: if you get a second internship or your internship lasts longer than a semester, you can get enroll
  in an **additional** 3 credit hours of CSCE 495 which can substitute for a 400-level technical elective!

## Additional Notes

For any information regarding internships, consult with Bhuvana Gopal <bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu>

1. If the company that the student wants to intern with is not listed in the dropdown on the portal website mentioned in the attached pdf, please have the student reach out to (<bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu>) with the company name and full mailing address including zip code, and I will add it to the list. Once I do so they can proceed with the steps outlined in the pdf.

2. Regardless of what the duration of their internship is for the summer, starting Summer of 2024, we only have one 5 week session of CSCE 495 we offer. Students who have internships with varying durations can contact me by email and I can work with them on ensuring that their academic contract is met correctly.

3. Often, students come to me without consulting the academic advisors and figuring out how many credits they need to take CSCE 495 for. So please let them know they need to meet with you first to figure out the number of credits.
If the student wishes to work with a faculty member on research related opportunities and count that as an internship, please have them consult you before they do so, and determine that CSCE 495 is the right venue for them, and not a directed independent study. If you feel that they need it for the internship requirement since they are unable to find an outside internship (i.e, if the academic advisor approves of the students taking CSCE 495 for research), I am happy to let them enroll.

4. If the student requires a CPT form that lists CSCE 495 as the course for the CPT, then they need to fill it out completely, and send it to me as an editable pdf where I will insert my signature and send it back to them.

5. Any forms through the ISSO, that involve immigration, go through the advising staff, not me.
