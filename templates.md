## Welcome Message

Greetings.  I'm Dr. Chris Bourke, Associate Professor of Practice in the
School of Computing.  I've been assigned as your new faculty advisor and I
wanted to introduce myself.  If you need something please reach out through
the Student Success Hub (https://unlincoln.my.site.com/SSH).  I hold weekly
advising hours and an appointment can be made in person if necessary.  
However, the best way to communicate is electronically either through the
Student Success Hub or via email (chris.bourke@unl.edu).  I look forward
to working with you going forward!

## Advising Holds

When Engineering students reach a certain number of hours (typically at the end
of their second year), an advising hold is placed on their account that will
prevent them from registering until they have met with an advisor to plan the
rest of their matriculation.

Greetings.  Good luck to everyone on the start of a brand new semester.  You
may or may not have noticed that you recently had a hold placed on your academic
record for "Graduation Planning".  This is normal and nothing to worry about.  
It does mean, however that this semester is the time to start planning the
remainder of your semesters as a Software Engineer.

At some point in this semester you will need to meet with me to release this
hold so you can register for fall 20XX.  You can schedule an appointment
through the Student Success Hub: https://unlincoln.my.site.com/SSH

My advising hours for spring 20XX are XXXX.  You must schedule an in-person
appointment through the Success Hub.

Before you meet with me, be sure to:
1. Run a Degree Audit to see what requirements and courses you need to
   complete; instructions are available here:
   https://registrar.unl.edu/student/my-degree-audit/
2. Plan the rest of your degree using the Degree Planner application;
   instructions are available here: https://registrar.unl.edu/degree-planner/

In any and all communications, please include your full NUID.  
Good luck with your classes!
