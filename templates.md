## Welcome Message

Greetings.  I'm Dr. Chris Bourke, Associate Professor of Practice in the
School of Computing.  I've been assigned as your new faculty advisor and I
wanted to introduce myself.  If you need something please reach out through
the Student Success Hub (https://unlincoln.my.site.com/SSH).  I hold weekly
advising hours and an appointment can be made in person if necessary.  
However, the best way to communicate is electronically either through the
Student Success Hub or via email (chris.bourke@unl.edu).  I look forward
to working with you going forward!

## Annual Message

Greetings.  We have about a week until classes start but I wanted to send a message to all of my advisees and welcome you back to a new year!  I hope you had a good summer.  At some point this semester you may need to meet with me for advising.  My advising hours for Fall 2024 will be Wednesdays and Fridays 10:30 - 11:30 which will be held in my office, Schorr 105.  You must set an appointment through the Student Success Hub: https://unlincoln.my.site.com/SSH

Before you meet with me, be sure to:
1. Run a Degree Audit to see what requirements and courses you need to
   complete; instructions are available here:
   https://registrar.unl.edu/student/my-degree-audit/
2. Plan the rest of your degree using the Degree Planner application;
   instructions are available here: https://registrar.unl.edu/degree-planner/

In any and all communications, please include your full NUID.  

Good luck with your classes!

Dr. Chris Bourke
Professor of Practice

## Internship Message

Greetings.  As most of you may know, all Software Engineering majors are required to complete an internship for credit as part of their degree requirements.  The internship should be computing-oriented and may be paid or unpaid and may be with a company, non-profit, or other entity.  To receive credit, you must enroll in CSCE 495 for *exactly* 1 credit hour.  Full instructions on this process are available here: https://github.com/cbourke/Advising/blob/main/documents/CSCE495-enrollmentProcess.pdf (download the PDF to view if it does not render in github).  Additional information is provided here: https://github.com/cbourke/Advising/blob/main/documents/CSCE495.md.  All questions about the online internship system need to be directed to Dr. Bhuvana Gopal (bhuvana.gopal@unl.edu).

In addition, you may take a second internship credit (which may be at the same company but over a different period) for 3 credit hours which would substitute for a technical elective (a non-required CSCE or SOFT 400-level course).  You would follow the same process as above.

Be aware that you may apply the credit hours in any semester.  If you have a summer internship I recommend applying the hours in the subsequent fall semester to avoid additional summer enrollment fees.

## Advising Holds

When Engineering students reach a certain number of hours (typically at the end
of their second year), an advising hold is placed on their account that will
prevent them from registering until they have met with an advisor to plan the
rest of their matriculation.

### Template

Greetings.  Good luck to everyone on the start of a brand new semester.  You
may or may not have noticed that you recently had a hold placed on your academic
record for "Graduation Planning".  This is normal and nothing to worry about.  
It does mean, however that this semester is the time to start planning the
remainder of your semesters as a Software Engineer.

At some point in this semester you will need to meet with me to release this
hold so you can register for fall 20XX.  You can schedule an appointment
through the Student Success Hub: https://unlincoln.my.site.com/SSH

My advising hours for spring 20XX are XXXX.  You must schedule an in-person
appointment through the Success Hub.

Before you meet with me, be sure to:
1. Run a Degree Audit to see what requirements and courses you need to
   complete; instructions are available here:
   https://registrar.unl.edu/student/my-degree-audit/
2. Plan the rest of your degree using the Degree Planner application;
   instructions are available here: https://registrar.unl.edu/degree-planner/

In any and all communications, please include your full NUID.  
Good luck with your classes!
